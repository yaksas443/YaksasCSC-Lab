This is the GitHub repository for my course Red Team Adversary Emulation. 

## About the course

In this course, we look at an organization's security from a real-world adversary perspective. We are hired by Tax First Labz (a FinTech startup) to conduct an adversary emulation exercise and steal their customer data (before an actual adversary). Though this exercise assumes zero knowledge about the target network, most of Tax First Labz infrastructure is in scope for this exercise.

During an adversary emulation exercise we mimic a real world cyber attack with a specific objective, such as stealing customer data, launching a ransomwar attack etc. This course follows the Red Team Operations Attack Lifecycle to conduct this exercise. We go through each phase in a step-by-step manner and build our attack path as we move ahead. We employee a variety of techniques, such as

- Active and passive information gathering
- Gaining foothold into the network
- Host Discovery
- Brute-forcing
- Phishing
- Privilege Escalation (Linux and Windows)
- Automated Active Directory domain enumeration
- Persistence via command and control centre
- Active Directory attacks
 
to acheive our objective. Upon completion of the exercise, we will prepare and submit a report to Tax First Labz management.    

This course also covers installation and usage of tools such as, PoshC2, Mentalist, BloodHound, Mimikatz, Metasploit, PowerUp, icacls, PowerShell etc.

This is a beginner friendly course. If you have just started your career in offensive cybersecurity or are preparing for pentertion testing exams then this course is for you. If you are already a penetration tester or a red teamer, with a few years of experience under your belt, then you would already know most of the above mentioned techniques. However, if you are interested in witnessing a live adversary emulation exercise, please feel free to follow along.
