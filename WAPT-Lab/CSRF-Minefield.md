# Welcome to CSRF Minefield!

CSRF Minefield is an Ubuntu Server 18.04 based virtual machine, that is heavily ridden with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. This VM hosts 11 real-world web applications that were found vulnerable to CSRF vulnerability and your aim is to find them and detonate them before they explode the target network.

## What is CSRF?

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.  - [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))

## How to find or test for a CSRF vulnerability?

As a starting point, you can use the following resources by the OWASP Project:

[OWASP Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project)
[OWASP Code Review Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project)
